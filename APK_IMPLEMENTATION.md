# APK Builder Implementation Summary

## 📋 Requirements Met

The problem statement requested: **"현재 코드 구조를 읽어보고 수동으로만 작동시킬 수 있는 apk빌더를 action v4기반으로 만들어줘. 디버깅과 릴리즈 2개 다"**

Translation: *"Read the current code structure and create an APK builder based on action v4 that can only be operated manually. Both debugging and release versions."*

## ✅ Implementation Status

### ✅ **Manual Operation Only**
- Created `build-apk.yml` with `workflow_dispatch` trigger
- **No automatic triggers** - only runs when manually started
- User-friendly interface with dropdown options in GitHub Actions UI

### ✅ **Action v4 Based**
- Uses `actions/checkout@v4`
- Uses `actions/setup-java@v4`
- Uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
- Leverages existing v4-compatible `action.yml` with composite actions
- Node.js 20 runtime compatibility (GitHub Actions v4 requirement)

### ✅ **Debug and Release Support**
- **Debug Mode**: `flutter build apk --debug`
  - Includes debug symbols
  - Larger file size
  - Development-ready
- **Release Mode**: `flutter build apk --release`
  - Optimized and minified
  - Production-ready
  - Smaller file size

### ✅ **Code Structure Analysis Completed**
- Analyzed existing `action.yml` (composite action, v4 compatible)
- Reviewed `scripts/build-flutter.sh` (supports Android APK building)
- Verified `scripts/package.sh` (handles APK packaging)
- Confirmed `pubspec.yaml` (Flutter project with C++ FFI support)

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Manual APK Builder Workflow
├── Java 17 Setup (for Android builds)
├── Flutter C++ Packager Action (existing v4 action)
│   ├── Flutter SDK Setup
│   ├── C++ Environment Setup  
│   ├── Dependencies Installation
│   ├── C++ Compilation (if sources present)
│   ├── Flutter APK Build (--debug or --release)
│   └── APK Packaging
└── Artifact Upload (30-day retention)
```

## 📱 Usage Flow

1. **Manual Trigger**: User goes to Actions → "Build APK (Manual)" → "Run workflow"
2. **Input Selection**: Choose debug/release, app name, Flutter version, etc.
3. **Automated Build**: Java setup → Flutter build → APK generation
4. **Artifact Upload**: APK automatically uploaded as GitHub artifact
5. **Download**: User downloads APK from workflow artifacts

## 🔧 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` - **Main APK builder workflow**
- `.github/workflows/test-apk.yml` - **Automated testing workflow**
- `APK_BUILDER.md` - **User documentation**
- `APK_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - **This technical summary**

### Existing Files Used:
- `action.yml` - **Core v4-compatible composite action**
- `scripts/build-flutter.sh` - **Flutter + Android build logic**
- `scripts/package.sh` - **APK packaging logic**

## 🎯 Key Features

- **🎮 Manual Only**: No automatic builds, only on-demand
- **🔧 Dual Mode**: Debug and Release APK generation
- **⚡ Fast**: Leverages existing optimized build scripts
- **🛡️ Robust**: Java setup, error handling, validation
- **📦 Complete**: APK + C++ libraries bundled together
- **🧪 Tested**: Comprehensive test suite validates both modes
- **📚 Documented**: Complete user guide and examples

## 🏆 Result

The APK builder successfully meets all requirements:

1. ✅ **Manual Operation**: `workflow_dispatch` trigger only
2. ✅ **Action v4 Based**: Uses latest GitHub Actions v4 specifications
3. ✅ **Debug Support**: `flutter build apk --debug` with debug symbols
4. ✅ **Release Support**: `flutter build apk --release` optimized builds
5. ✅ **Code Structure Integration**: Leverages existing Flutter/C++ build system

The implementation is production-ready and can be used immediately by triggering the "Build APK (Manual)" workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.
