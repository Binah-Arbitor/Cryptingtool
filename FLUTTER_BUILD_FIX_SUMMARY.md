# Flutter Build Fix - Network Issues Workaround

Due to network connectivity limitations in this environment, we've successfully implemented all the Flutter Android v2 embedding configuration changes, but cannot test the final build. Here's what has been accomplished and what should work in an environment with proper network access:

## âœ… Completed Configuration Changes

1. **AndroidManifest.xml**: Added Flutter v2 embedding metadata
2. **MainActivity**: Converted from Java AppCompatActivity to Kotlin FlutterActivity  
3. **build.gradle**: Updated with modern Flutter Gradle plugin
4. **settings.gradle**: Added Flutter plugin management and SDK path resolution
5. **themes.xml**: Added NormalTheme style definition
6. **local.properties**: Created with Flutter SDK path configuration

All verification checks pass âœ…

## ðŸ”§ Manual Steps for Testing

In an environment with proper network access:

1. **Install Flutter SDK**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using snap
   sudo snap install flutter --classic
   
   # Option 2: Manual download
   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.24.5-stable.tar.xz
   tar xf flutter_linux_3.24.5-stable.tar.xz
   export PATH="$PATH:$PWD/flutter/bin"
   ```

2. **Update local.properties** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Update flutter.sdk path in android/local.properties
   flutter.sdk=/path/to/your/flutter
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Build the APK**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

## Expected Result

The "Build failed due to use of deleted Android v1 embedding" error should now be resolved because we have:
- Configured Flutter v2 embedding metadata in AndroidManifest.xml
- Changed MainActivity to extend FlutterActivity instead of AppCompatActivity
- Updated the build system to use the modern Flutter Gradle plugin
- Added proper theme configuration for Flutter

The verification script confirms all required components are in place.
