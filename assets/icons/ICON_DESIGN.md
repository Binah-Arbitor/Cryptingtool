# CryptingTool App Icon Design

## Design Concept
The CryptingTool app icon features a **top-down view of a CPU chip** with **enhanced blue-themed asymmetrical PCB circuit traces** and **internal processing unit details**, set against a **dark circuit board background**. The design emphasizes **glowing neon blue lines** that flow organically across the circuit board, creating a **futuristic and high-tech cyber aesthetic**.

## Design Philosophy
The icon represents **advanced blue-themed PCB/circuit board engineering** with **futuristic neon aesthetics** - suggesting that the cryptographic tool operates at a hardware level with the precision and reliability of cutting-edge electronic systems. The **flowing organic blue traces** mixed with **angular circuit patterns** create a **cyber-tech** aesthetic that emphasizes:

- **푸른색 계열 (Blue Color Family)**: Full spectrum of blue tones from electric to neon
- **빛나는 네온 라인 (Glowing Neon Lines)**: Enhanced glow effects with multi-layer illumination  
- **미래적이고 기술적 (Futuristic & Technical)**: Complex flowing circuit patterns
- **디지털, 하이테크, 사이버 감성 (Digital High-tech Cyber Aesthetic)**: Modern electronic design
- **정교한 회로와 칩 (Sophisticated Circuits & Chips)**: Detailed PCB components and traces
- **심플하고 현대적 스타일 (Simple & Modern Style)**: Clean, scalable icon design
