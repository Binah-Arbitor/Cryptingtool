# SDK Installation Enhancement - 2025 Update

## Problem Statement

Korean: "sdkÏùºÎ∂ÄÍ∞Ä ÏÑ§Ïπò Îçú ÎêêÎã§ÎäîÎç∞ action ÌôòÍ≤ΩÏ¢Ä Îã§Ïãú ÌôïÏù∏Ìï¥"
English: "Some SDK parts seem to be not fully installed, please check the action environment again"

The GitHub Actions workflow was experiencing issues with incomplete SDK installations, specifically:

1. **Partial Android SDK Installation**: Components missing or not properly configured
2. **License Acceptance Failures**: "1 of 7 SDK package license not accepted" errors
3. **Flutter Action Compatibility**: Outdated action versions causing issues
4. **Environment Validation**: Insufficient verification of SDK components

## Root Cause Analysis

Through comprehensive investigation, the following issues were identified:

### 1. Outdated Flutter Action Version
- **Issue**: Using `subosito/flutter-action@v2` without latest features
- **Impact**: Missing caching improvements and bug fixes
- **Latest**: `v2.21.0` available with significant improvements

### 2. Insufficient License Acceptance Mechanism
- **Issue**: Single-method license acceptance prone to timeouts
- **Impact**: Build failures due to unaccepted SDK licenses
- **Solution**: Multi-method fallback approach needed

### 3. Limited SDK Verification
- **Issue**: No comprehensive verification of SDK installation completeness
- **Impact**: Silent failures and incomplete installations
- **Solution**: Enhanced diagnostic and verification tools needed

### 4. Environment Configuration Gaps
- **Issue**: Insufficient validation of environment variables and paths
- **Impact**: SDK components not properly detected or configured

## Comprehensive Solution

### 1. Updated Flutter Action to Latest Version

**Updated to `subosito/flutter-action@v2.21.0`** with enhanced features:

```yaml
- name: Setup Flutter (Channel-based)
  uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2.21.0
  with:
    channel: ${{ inputs.flutter-version }}
    cache: true
    cache-key: flutter-:os:-:channel:-:version:-:arch:-:hash:
    cache-path: ${{ runner.tool_cache }}/flutter/:channel:-:version:-:arch:
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced caching for faster builds
- ‚úÖ Improved cache hit detection
- ‚úÖ Better dynamic path support
- ‚úÖ Latest bug fixes and stability improvements

### 2. Multi-Method License Acceptance System

Implemented **three-tier fallback system** for reliable license acceptance:

#### Method 1: Enhanced PowerShell Process Management
```powershell
# Enhanced PowerShell-native approach with better timeout handling
$yesResponses = @()
for ($i = 1; $i -le 10; $i++) {
  $yesResponses += "y"
}
$responseString = ($yesResponses -join "`r`n") + "`r`n"

$psi = New-Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo
$psi.FileName = "flutter"
$psi.Arguments = "doctor --android-licenses"
$psi.RedirectStandardInput = $true
$psi.RedirectStandardOutput = $true
$psi.RedirectStandardError = $true
$psi.UseShellExecute = $false
$psi.WorkingDirectory = (Get-Location).Path

$process = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($psi)
$process.StandardInput.Write($responseString)
$process.StandardInput.Flush()
$process.StandardInput.Close()

# Wait with reasonable timeout (3 minutes)
$timeoutMs = 180000
if ($process.WaitForExit($timeoutMs)) {
  Write-Host "‚úÖ Android licenses accepted successfully"
} else {
  $process.Kill()
  # Proceed to fallback method
}
```

#### Method 2: Batch File Fallback
- Creates temporary batch file for license acceptance
- Uses PowerShell jobs with timeout control
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

#### Method 3: Direct SDK Manager Approach
- Locates Android SDK installation
- Uses `sdkmanager --licenses` directly
- Handles various SDK installation paths

### 3. Comprehensive SDK Verification Tool

**New Script**: `scripts/verify-sdk.sh`

**Features**:
- üîç **Complete SDK Detection**: Checks Flutter, Android SDK, Java, and build tools
