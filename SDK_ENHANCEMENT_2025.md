# SDK Installation Enhancement - 2025 Update

## Problem Statement

Korean: "sdk일부가 설치 덜 됐다는데 action 환경좀 다시 확인해"
English: "Some SDK parts seem to be not fully installed, please check the action environment again"

The GitHub Actions workflow was experiencing issues with incomplete SDK installations, specifically:

1. **YAML Package Formatting Issue**: Multi-line package list treated as single string
2. **License Acceptance Failures**: "1 of 7 SDK package license not accepted" errors
3. **Command-line Tools Version**: Outdated cmdline-tools causing compatibility issues
4. **Timeout Issues**: License acceptance hanging indefinitely

## Root Cause Analysis

Through comprehensive investigation and Stack Overflow research, the following issues were identified:

### 1. YAML Package Formatting Error (Primary Issue)
- **Issue**: Multi-line YAML `packages:` section treated as single package string
- **Error**: `Failed to find package 'platforms;android-32\nplatforms;android-33...'`
- **Solution**: Convert to single-line space-separated format
- **Stack Overflow Reference**: Common YAML parsing issue in GitHub Actions

### 2. Insufficient License Acceptance Mechanism
- **Issue**: Single-method license acceptance prone to timeouts
- **Impact**: Build failures due to unaccepted SDK licenses
- **Solution**: Multi-method fallback approach with timeouts and retries

### 3. Incorrect Command-line Tools Version Format  
- **Issue**: Using short version format '12.0' instead of required long version format
- **Error**: HTTP 404 when downloading commandlinetools-linux-12.0_latest.zip
- **Solution**: Use correct long version format '11076708' (which corresponds to version 12.0)
- **Impact**: Action fails with "Wrong version in preinstalled sdkmanager" error

### 4. Environment Configuration Gaps
- **Issue**: Insufficient validation of environment variables and paths
- **Impact**: SDK components not properly detected or configured

## Comprehensive Solution

### 1. Fixed YAML Package Formatting (Primary Fix)

**Before (Problematic multi-line format)**:
```yaml
packages: |
  platforms;android-32
  platforms;android-33
  platforms;android-34
  platforms;android-35
  build-tools;34.0.0
  build-tools;35.0.0
  ndk;26.1.10909125
  cmake;3.22.1
  platform-tools
```

**After (Correct single-line format)**:
```yaml
packages: 'platforms;android-32 platforms;android-33 platforms;android-34 platforms;android-35 build-tools;34.0.0 build-tools;35.0.0 ndk;26.1.10909125 cmake;3.22.1 platform-tools'
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Proper package parsing by sdkmanager
- ✅ Eliminates "Failed to find package" errors
- ✅ Maintains all required SDK components
- ✅ Compatible with android-actions/setup-android@v3

### 2. Enhanced License Acceptance System

**Implemented multi-method approach with timeout and retry mechanisms**:

```yaml
- name: Accept Android Licenses (Enhanced)
  run: |
    echo "📝 Accepting Android SDK licenses with enhanced method..."
    # Method 1: Standard acceptance with timeout
    timeout 120 bash -c 'yes | ${ANDROID_SDK_ROOT}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses' || echo "⚠️ Method 1 timed out"
    
    # Method 2: Fallback with specific license acceptance (Stack Overflow solution)
    echo "🔄 Fallback license acceptance method..."
    for i in {1..3}; do
      echo "Attempt $i/3"
      if timeout 60 bash -c 'echo -e "y\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny\ny" | ${ANDROID_SDK_ROOT}/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses'; then
        echo "✅ Licenses accepted successfully"
        break
      else
        echo "⚠️ Attempt $i failed, retrying..."
        sleep 2
      fi
    done
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ 120-second timeout prevents infinite hanging
- ✅ 3-attempt retry mechanism with 2-second delays  
- ✅ Multiple license acceptance methods for reliability
- ✅ Based on proven Stack Overflow solutions

### 3. Fixed Command-line Tools Version Format

**Issue Fixed**: The workflow was using short version format '12.0' instead of required long version format.

**Corrected from**:
```yaml
cmdline-tools-version: '12.0'  # WRONG - This is short version format
```

**To**:
```yaml
cmdline-tools-version: '11076708'  # CORRECT - Long version format for 12.0
```

**Version Mapping**:
- Short version 12.0 → Long version 11076708
- Short version 16.0 → Long version 12266719 (latest)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Fixes HTTP 404 error when downloading command-line tools  
- ✅ Uses correct version format expected by android-actions/setup-android@v3
- ✅ Eliminates "Wrong version in preinstalled sdkmanager" errors
- ✅ Enhanced error reporting
$psi.UseShellExecute = $false
$psi.WorkingDirectory = (Get-Location).Path

$process = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($psi)
$process.StandardInput.Write($responseString)
$process.StandardInput.Flush()
$process.StandardInput.Close()

# Wait with reasonable timeout (3 minutes)
$timeoutMs = 180000
if ($process.WaitForExit($timeoutMs)) {
  Write-Host "✅ Android licenses accepted successfully"
} else {
  $process.Kill()
  # Proceed to fallback method
}
```

#### Method 2: Batch File Fallback
- Creates temporary batch file for license acceptance
- Uses PowerShell jobs with timeout control
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

#### Method 3: Direct SDK Manager Approach
- Locates Android SDK installation
- Uses `sdkmanager --licenses` directly
- Handles various SDK installation paths
