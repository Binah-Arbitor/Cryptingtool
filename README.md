# CryptingTool - High-Performance File Encryption Utility

A Flutter-based UI for a high-performance file encryption/decryption utility with PCB/Cyber-Tech aesthetic design. This application provides a modern, intuitive interface for file encryption operations using various cryptographic algorithms.

## Features

### ðŸ”’ Encryption & Decryption
- Support for multiple encryption algorithms (AES, Serpent, Twofish, RC6, Blowfish, Camellia)
- Configurable key lengths (128, 192, 256 bits)
- Multiple operation modes (CBC, GCM, ECB, CFB, OFB, CTR)
- Dynamic algorithm compatibility - UI adapts available options based on selected algorithm

### ðŸŽ¨ PCB/Cyber-Tech UI Design
- Dark theme with deep off-black background (#0A0A0A)
- Teal/Cyan accent colors for interactive elements
- Lime green for success states
- Circuit board-inspired design elements
- Monospace fonts for technical aesthetic

### ðŸš€ Advanced Features
- **Multithreading Control**: Configurable worker threads with efficiency monitoring
- **Real-time Logging**: Live console with color-coded log levels
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators and status monitoring
- **System Integration**: Automatic CPU core detection and optimization
- **File Compatibility**: Support for all file types

### ðŸ“± UI Components
- **File I/O Panel**: Drag-and-drop file selection with encryption/decryption actions
- **Encryption Config Panel**: Algorithm, key length, operation mode, and password settings
- **Advanced Settings Panel**: Multithreading controls and performance tuning
- **Live Log Console**: Expandable console with real-time backend communication logs
- **Status Panel**: Progress bar and system status indicators

## Architecture

### UI Structure
- **Single-screen layout** with expandable panels for efficient space usage
- **Modular widget system** with separate components for each major feature
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes

### Backend Communication
- **Service Layer**: `BackendService` handles communication with C++ backend
